"""
Langchain Example: Retrievers with Okta FGA (Fine-Grained Authorization)

It performs the following steps:
   1. Defines a user ID.
   2. Reads documents from a data source.
   3. Creates a MemoryStore from the documents.
   4. Sets up a RetrievalChain with an FGARetriever to enforce permissions.
   5. Executes a query and logs the response.

The FGARetriever checks if the user has the "viewer" relation to the document
based on predefined tuples in Okta FGA.

Example:
- A tuple {user: "user:*", relation: "viewer", object: "doc:public-doc"} allows all users to view "public-doc".
- A tuple {user: "user:user1", relation: "viewer", object: "doc:private-doc"} allows "user1" to view "private-doc".

The output of the query depends on the user's permissions to view the documents.
